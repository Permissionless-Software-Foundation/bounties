# PSF Bounties
This is a non-code repository. This repository is used to list and track code bounties that are funded by [PSF Grants](https://psfoundation.cash/grants/).

## Ready Bounties
To find bounty-tagged tasks that are ready to claim, look at the [Bounty Task Spreadsheet](./bounties.csv) Any tasks with the `Ready` label are open and can be claimed by anyone.

To claim the bounty, you must first state your intention on the [PSF Telegram Channel](https://t.me/permissionless_software). PSF management will assess your skills and history. If you are approved to work on a bounty, the bounty will be tagged with your name. This process ensures that bounties are accomplished in a reasonable time frame and are well matched to a developers skill set. It also provides a chance for senior developers to mentor junior developers.
