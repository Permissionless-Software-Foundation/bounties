# Token Info Commands

**Bounty**: $200 USD paid in BCH tokens

## Overview

The [psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet) needs commands for retrieving additional information about tokens.

## Scope
The scope of this task is to add two commands to psf-bch-wallet:
- **token-info** - Given a token ID, this command should return the Genesis data, mutable data, and immutable data associated with the token.
- **token-tx-history** - Given a token ID, this command should return the transaction history of the token.

## Deliverables

Each command should be fully functional, and include 100% unit test coverage.
